This mod prevents NPCs and Crew members from starting social interaction with the player.
NPCs can still interact with eachother and the player can interact with them, but it prevents them from starting the conversation. Especially useful for when you are accessing your inventory or looking through a menu to prevent interuptions and annoyances.
